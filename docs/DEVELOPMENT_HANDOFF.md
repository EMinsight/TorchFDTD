# Development handoff

The latest real state of the completion program, written at the end of every
working session as [COMPLETION_PROGRAM_KO.md](COMPLETION_PROGRAM_KO.md)
section 13 requires. Each entry records the commit, the changed files, the
exact commands, the devices, the measurements, what passed, failed, skipped or
was not run, the evidence paths, the blockers and the first command of the next
session. Nothing here promises that a later session runs automatically.

## Entry format

### 2026-09-21 G0-01 to G0-05 (evidence and gate infrastructure), branch completion-gates from f3efd34

**Problem or goal.** Adopt the owner's completion package (2026-09-21,
MASTER_PROMPT_KO.md SHA-256 `f410a65dfbb906f92ff6111bc049f3d3a64761dc9e851b86e2f2e9f21c998ff4`,
completion_checklist.json SHA-256 `e1244686b4992b0718ce24c36efbe2d3c8c710260ebc6c2be962d1ded32d02a3`)
as the specification of record, connect the gate file, the case and run
directories and the release-scope document, and build a recorder and a judge
that refuse hand-written VERIFIED states.

**State found.** HEAD f3efd34 on branch completion-gates, clean tree, no
uncommitted work from an earlier agent. The package's planning snapshot
2b8f493 is an ancestor of HEAD; commits since then are ca79616 (README rows and
quick start, G1-06), f6deadb (manuscript wording) and f3efd34 (quadrant
allocation scaling, G1-03).

**Changed files (why).**
- `docs/COMPLETION_PROGRAM_KO.md`: the master prompt verbatim with a two-line header (`tail -n +4` reproduces the package hash).
- `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN_KO.md`: one section pointing to the program, the gate file, the scope, cases, runs and this file.
- `docs/validation/completion_gates.json`: the checklist adopted with `kind` `completion_gates`, `adopted_commit` f3efd34, `specification_of_record`, a `required_tests` list on every task, code paths for G0, G1, G5-07 to G5-09, G8-05, G9-01 to G9-03 and H1-01 to H1-03, `implementation_state` IMPLEMENTED for G0-01 to G0-05, G1-03 (fixed in f3efd34) and G1-06 (README in ca79616), the two-GPU blocker on H1-02 to H1-06. Every `verification_state` is NOT_RUN.
- `docs/RELEASE_SCOPE.md`: WORKSTATION and HPC rows with implemented versus verified columns; HPC BLOCKED_EXTERNAL.
- `docs/validation/cases/README.md`, `docs/validation/cases/G1-03_quadrant_allocation_scaling.json`: case format and the first pre-declared case.
- `docs/validation/runs/README.md`: run directory layout and the recorder's decision table.
- `scripts/release_audit.py`: `file_sha256` helper extracted from the inline hash so the gate tools share it.
- `scripts/record_gate_evidence.py`: the recorder. `scripts/check_release_gates.py`: the judge.
- `tests/test_release_gates.py`: 18 failure-injection tests on a temporary git repository.

**Commands run (device: local Windows 11, 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700, RTX 3060 12 GB, driver 591.86, Python 3.10.2, torch 2.10.0+cu126, CuPy 13.6.0; TMP and TEMP set to D:\TorchFDTD\.local\tmp).**

```
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_release_gates.py
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_detector_allocation.py --junitxml=D:/TorchFDTD/.local/tmp/junit_probe.xml

D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_release_gates.py --profile HPC
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_release_gates.py --task G1-03
```

**Measurements.** tests/test_release_gates.py: 18 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
in 18.42 s on the final run (an earlier run took 30.11 s, and the first run
with a cold torch import took 67.66 s and exposed one test bug, fixed before
commit). tests/test_detector_allocation.py: 26 passed,
0 skipped, 9.76 s, CUDA instances ran on the RTX 3060. The judge exits 1 on
both profiles with 77 (WORKSTATION) and 83 (HPC) tasks judged, 0 pass, all
NOT_RUN, and the H1 rows report the two-GPU blocker. A dry run of the recorder
on the real tree produced a VERIFIED evidence record for G1-03 in 5.4 s; it was
deleted and the gate file regenerated because the tree was dirty with the new
scripts and the integrator, not this session, records gate evidence.

**Passed / failed / skipped / not run.** Passed: the 18 gate tests and the 26
allocation tests above. Failed: none. Skipped: none. Not run: every gate task
remains NOT_RUN by design; no evidence directory exists under
docs/validation/runs yet.

**Evidence paths and hashes.** None recorded in the gate file. The JUnit of the
allocation run is a scratch file, D:/TorchFDTD/.local/tmp/junit_probe.xml,
SHA-256 `7e69d223bbfa66500b6745a23c20609eb44ff11cc7bb5cfb67300c4ba6f586c9`,
executed 2026-09-21T22:42:38+09:00 at f3efd34 with the new scripts untracked.

**Remaining defects, risks, external blockers.**
- HPC: BLOCKED_EXTERNAL, no two-GPU host (blocker text on H1-02 to H1-06).
- G1-01, G1-02, G1-04 and G1-05 are being worked on in separate worktrees; their gate rows stay NOT_ASSESSED until those fixes merge.
- G1-03 has a pre-declared case with three `not_yet_covered` items (amplitude 1e-8, nonuniform areas/frequencies/phases at DFT scale, whole-source scale invariance) that need tests before the task is complete against the specification.
- The gate file's profile `scope_status` is still DRAFT_PENDING_RECONCILIATION_WITH_EXISTING_REQUIREMENTS; the judge prints it and does not fail on it.
- The recorder hashes the working tree of tracked files; a run recorded on a dirty tree is warned about, not rejected.

**Next first command and task id.** After merging this branch, record the
G0 evidence and then start G1-01:

```
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_release_gates.py --junitxml=D:/TorchFDTD/.local/tmp/junit_release_gates.xml
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/record_gate_evidence.py --task G0-05 --command "D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_release_gates.py --junitxml=D:/TorchFDTD/.local/tmp/junit_release_gates.xml" --junit D:/TorchFDTD/.local/tmp/junit_release_gates.xml --exit-code 0
D:/TorchFDTD/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_release_gates.py --task G0-05
```

Then G1-01: run `tests/test_adjoint_planes.py` and `tests/test_plane_execution.py`
with `--junitxml`, reproduce the graded-mesh regeneration on the current
candidate, and record the result.
