# Full-aperture tiled-adjoint design of three metasurfaces

Code, settings, final layouts and source data of the three freeform designs E1-E3 of the accompanying preprint
(H. Park and Y. Park, 2026). Each design is a density-based topology optimization over the whole aperture: every step solves
all tiles of the aperture forward and adjoint with TorchFDTD (3D FDTD, 20 nm Yee lattice), assembles the exit-plane Jones maps,
propagates them with a vector angular spectrum to the objective, and updates a filtered, tanh-projected density with Adam.

Common physics: SiN pillars 700 nm tall (n = 2.0) on SiO2 (n = 1.444), 2.5 um tall tile domain with CPML along z and periodic
lateral faces, 1200 time steps, float32 fields, complex128 propagation. Objectives are defined in `src/fa_objectives.py`.

Load a layout:

```python
import numpy as np
z = np.load("designs/e3_freeform_step0189.npz")
nx, ny = z["d10_shape"]
layout = np.unpackbits(z["d10_bits"])[:nx * ny].reshape(nx, ny)   # 1 = SiN, 10 nm pixels
```

The key names differ per file (`d10_quad`, `d10_bits` or `d10_full`, with the matching `*_shape`); the `note` field of each
file says which.

## Requirements

- Linux, NVIDIA GPUs (tested on H100 80GB and H200). One E1/E2 tile solve peaks at 37-40 GiB; an E3 tile (25 um core) needs
  about 64 GiB and therefore an H200-class GPU at these settings.
- Host RAM: with `FA_KEEP_TRACE=1` (the setting of the runs) each rank keeps forward boundary traces in pinned host memory, capped
  by `FF_HOST_GIB`. On smaller nodes set `FA_KEEP_TRACE=0` (same gradient to float32 round-off, about 28 % slower).
- Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.8.0 (CUDA 12.8), NumPy 2.1, SciPy, CuPy 13 (`cupy-cuda12x`), and TorchFDTD at commit `9d97df2`, the
  version of the reported runs:

```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install "torchfdtd[cuda-kernels] @ git+https://github.com/hyoseokp/TorchFDTD@9d97df22384d2b788ee8ae9338f0d2c8456246ad"
```

## Evaluating the published layouts

```bash
bash evaluate.sh e1 designs/e1_freeform_step0248.npz     # or e2/e3 and any file in designs/
```

One forward solve per tile on all GPUs of the node (tile cores 15 um, margins 3.6 um), the homogeneous-substrate reference
solved first; the objective is printed and written to `runs/eval_<layout>/eval_*/metrics.json`. `EVAL_OVER` and `EVAL_TILE`
change the margin and the core. On 8 x H100 80GB the three freeform scores took 353 s (E1), 132 s (E2) and 113 s (E3).

## Running the optimizations

```bash
bash run.sh e1                         # or e2, e3; output in runs/<case>/, all GPUs of the node (NGPU to change)
bash evaluate.sh e1 runs/e1            # re-score the binary layout of the reference step with 3.6 um margins
python tools/compare_history.py e1 runs/e1
```

`run.sh` sources `configs/common.env` and `configs/<case>.env` and applies the beta of every step from `schedules/<case>.json`;
the learning rate follows from beta as lr(k) = min(0.05, 0.4 / beta(k)) * min(1, (k + 1) / 3). The gray start is 0.5 plus
uniform noise of amplitude 0.15 (seed 20260926). Running the same command again resumes after the last completed step, and
`touch runs/<case>/STOP` stops the run before its next step. E1 first builds `cache/d200_lookup.npz` (polar lookup of the octant,
about 250 MB and 30 s) and checks it against the SHA-256 of the lookup used in the reported run. Any `FF_*`, `EZ_*`, `EZC_*` or
`FA_*` variable set in the shell overrides the env files.

Repeated runs are not bitwise identical (float32 atomics and the NCCL reduction order differ at the 1e-7 relative level per
step), and E2's reported run changed from 6 to 8 GPUs at step 10, so a new run follows `reference/<case>_history.csv` closely
rather than to the last digit.

Checks without the full problem:

```bash
python tools/check_objectives.py   # CPU: the three objectives, target hashes, value and gradient on random pupil maps
bash smoke.sh e2                   # one GPU: the case's code path on a 6 um test lens, 2 steps
```

## Source data of the figures and tables

`figures/source_data/` holds, for each item of the preprint, the arrays it plots (`<item>.npz`, named `<record>__<key>`), the
JSON and CSV records it reads (`<item>.json`), and for each table every value behind it as (source, key, value) rows. The keys
name the record files of the original runs; those files themselves are not part of this folder.

| item | source data |
|---|---|
| Figs. 1-6 | `fig1.npz/.json` ... `fig6.json` (Fig. 6 includes the per-step histories of the three runs) |
| Extended Data Table 1 | `extended_data_table1.csv` |
| Supplementary Figs. 1-8 | `supp_fig1.json` ... `supp_fig8.json`, with `supp_fig2.npz`, `supp_fig6.npz`, `supp_fig7.npz` |
| Supplementary Figs. 9-12 | the layouts in `designs/` (`supp_fig9_12.json`) |
| Supplementary Tables 1-12 | `supp_table<k>_*.csv` |

Full three-dimensional fields are not stored; they can be regenerated with `evaluate.sh` and the layouts above.
